    "# Overview\n",
    "This notebook details the building, tuning and deployment of a categorical model that predicts whether an arrest was made during traffic stops by the Seattle Police. Tools utilized include but are not limited to K-Nearest Neighbors models, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data includes race and gender of both the officers and suspects, this will be a purely objective model based on public data and will not include further social commentary. Social issues regarding race and gender are outside of the scope of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "My data, methodology, and derived conclusions are summarized in the body of this document."

    "# Business Problem\n",
    "In the late 1960's, the supreme court ruled in Terry vs. Ohio that \"stop and frisk\" police tactics are not a violation of constitutional rights. Because of this, police can detain a person on the grounds of \"reasonable suspicion,\" even in the absence of clearer evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ruling lead to the coining of the term Terry Stop, which is when an officer of the law briefly detains a driver based on the reasonable suspician that the driver is involved in criminal activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on data from Terry Stops from the Seattle Police Department, a classifying model can be built to predict if a Terry Stop will result in an arrest, and from that model the most influencial factors in an arrest can be determined."

    "The data utilized in this project comes from [data.seattle.gov](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Terry-Stops/28ny-9ts8) and consists of 46.3k Terry Stops, as reported by the conducting officer. A [copy](data/Terry_Stops.csv) of the csv file can be found in the data folder of this repository or at [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/terry-stops)."

    "+ The data was cleaned and split into training and testing data sets.\n",
    "+ the training set was used to train K-Nearest Neighbor, decision tree, and random forest models.\n",
    "+ The models were evaluated, tuned, and tested to find the best performing model, the decision tree.\n",
    "+ The tuned decision tree provided the most important variables for predicting if a terry stop would result in an arrest."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "The most important feature to a random stop influencing if a subject is arrested is whether or not the subject was frisked. Following that is the age of the officer and whether or not the subject had any weapons. the type of weapon did not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree classifier trained with this data had an accuracy rating of about 75%"
